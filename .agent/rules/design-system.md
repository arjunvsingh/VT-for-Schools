# Summary

A high-contrast dark-mode design system with an editorial feel, using vibrant lime accents, sophisticated serif headings, and unique geometric cut-outs to create a premium, technical atmosphere.

# Style

The style blends 'Digital Naturalism' with brutalist technicality. It uses a core palette of deep charcoal (#0C0A09), warm stone (#E7E5E4), and a signature lime accent (#D4F268). Typography is a dual-system: 'Newsreader' for elegant, light-weight serif headings and 'Instrument Sans' for functional UI and body text. Visuals are treated with a fixed 4% opacity noise overlay to provide texture and organic 'analog' feel to the digital surfaces.

## Spec

- Background: #0C0A09 (Stone Black)
- Primary Accent: #D4F268 (Acid Lime) - used for highlights, primary buttons, and critical status markers.

- Neutral Foreground: #E7E5E4 (Off-white/Stone) - used for primary body text.

### Typography

- **Mono**: System monospace for technical identifiers (e.g., 'Fig. 1A').

### Effects & Global Styles
- **Noise Overlay**: Fixed position SVG fractal noise, opacity 0.04, mix-blend-mode: overlay.
- **Serrated Edges**: Section dividers using radial-gradient masks to create a jagged 'postage-stamp' or 'tear' effect (20px size).
- **Corner Radii**: 24px (Large) for primary cards, 9999px (Full) for buttons.
- **Transitions**: 300ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1).

# Layout & Structure

A structured yet dynamic layout featuring a fixed glassmorphism navigation bar, asymmetrical hero sections, and a signature 'bento-tab' layout for content sections.

## Navigation

Fixed top bar. Left: Logo with circular icon. Center: Pill-shaped navigation bar using #E7E5E4/5 background with heavy backdrop-blur (8px). Links have a 300ms transition to #E7E5E4 background with #0C0A09 text. Right: Primary CTA button in #D4F268 with rounded-full shape.

## Hero Section

Two-column grid (5:7 ratio). Left: H1 heading in Serif light weight, using Italics for the accent word. Sub-text in 60% opacity sans-serif. Social proof avatars with 70% opacity grayscale filter. Right: A large abstract image container with a 'rounded-top-arch' (10rem radius) and rectangular bottom. Includes a 'floating' sticky note badge in #D4F268 rotated at 6 degrees.

## Tabbed Main Content

A container with 'Folder' style navigation. Tabs are slightly rotated (-2 to -1 degrees) and overlap the main container. The active tab is larger and uses #D4F268. The content area below is #1C1917 with a serrated top edge. Background features a 40px grid pattern at 3% opacity.

## Showcase Grid

Cards with an aspect ratio of 3:4. Cards are #292524 with images that have a grayscale(100%) filter, becoming full color on hover. Titles are in Serif Italic. One card in the grid should have a vertical offset (Y-axis translation) to break the grid's rigidity.

# Special Components

## Serrated Edge Divider

A procedural jagged edge used to divide dark sections.

Implementation: Use a mask-image with a radial-gradient. `radial-gradient(circle at 10px 0, transparent 0, transparent 5px, black 5px)`. Set `mask-size: 20px 10px` and `mask-repeat: repeat-x`. Apply to a 16px high div placed at the boundary of two sections.

## Sticky Note CTA

A highlight card that mimics a physical note pinned to the interface.

Background: #D4F268. Text: #1C1917. Transform: rotate(2deg). Padding: 40px. Border-radius: 24px. On hover, transform: rotate(0deg) scale(1.02). Use Serif typography for the heading and include a bottom border-top with low opacity for an interactive footer within the card.

## Catalog Label

Technical metadata label for images.

Positioned absolute on images. Semi-transparent black background (40% opacity) with heavy backdrop-blur. Features a top row with 'Fig. No' in 10px monospace and a status dot in #D4F268.

# Special Notes

MUST use the noise overlay to prevent the dark colors from appearing flat. MUST NOT use standard pure black (#000000); use the stone-tinted #0C0A09. Headlines MUST use light weights (300 or lower) to maintain the 'Avant-Garde' editorial aesthetic. Icons should be monochrome Lucide-style line icons.
